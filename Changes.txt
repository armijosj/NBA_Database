nba_player: change instead of idSeason, we will store the number of season that player has played. 
            Therefore we would get rid of the plays during relation from nbaPLaer to season. 
            It does not affect the tables because there wasn't the table for that relation.
            also could not reference to team.

non_nbaPlayer: change attributes from type organization, name organization to height and weight. 
            Also make primary key idPlayer because there are players with the same name.

Referee to Game should be m to m. 
    Then we have a new table: oversees(idGame, idReferee1, idReferee2, idReferee3)

Game: get rid of the nameArena attribute because  
    it could be obtained from JOIN idTeam ON idTeamHome = idTeam;

Team to Game should be many to 1. This way we get rid of the face in table which doesn't make sense because 
game already has the two teamIDs.
